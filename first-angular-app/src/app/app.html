<!-- If you have a component that doesn't have anything between it's opening and closing tag which neither the header nor the user component have and we will learn how we could build Components that do accept content between their tags later.
 
But if we have components that don't have anything between their tags, we can simplify this code and simply write the self-closing Components like this "<app-user />"-->
